# Trans-Qrobot
To interpret a transufusion sheet you need to follow the rule of 2.
This is an early python script to help interpret a sheet in transfusion Lab.
The current goal is to implement with D-wave/
The value 1 is assined for a positive reaction and the value 0 is assigned for a negative reaction.
Allowing for a quantum computer to solve the problem would allow for a faster speed in addition to allow for a week reaction being expresed as 1 or 0.
